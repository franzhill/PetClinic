# PetClinic: my "pet" ;o) project ‚Äî a Spring, JPA & co technical playground
This project serves as a technical playground where I explore both common and advanced use cases of Spring Boot, JPA/Hibernate, and related technologies.
It aims to offer a clean, production-ready, and well-documented codebase that demonstrates how these technologies work in practice ‚Äî from everyday challenges to more complex architectural scenarios.

It also hosts a collection of focused exercises on Spring and Hibernate that I regularly submit to my team of junior developers as part of ongoing skills improvement and knowledge sharing.

# Showcased themes
## Done
### üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Project Structure
- Clean layering between **domain**, **service**, and **API** levels
- Use of `@RestControllerAdvice` for global HTTP exception mapping
- Package structure reflects clean boundaries (e.g. `api/exception` vs `service/exception`)
- Alignment with **Clean Architecture** principles

### üß™ Integration Testing & Fixtures
- Custom fixture framework with support for:
  - Direct DB fixture loading (fast)
  - API-based fixture loading (realistic)
- Use of `@TransactionalFixtureTest` for rollback-based test isolation
- JSON-based fixtures for both setup and expected results
- Meta-annotations and `TestExecutionListener` integration for declarative tests

### üõ¢Ô∏è Hibernate & JPA Mechanics
- Lazy vs. eager loading exploration
- Cascade, orphan removal, and lifecycle behavior
- Entity modeling for complex domains (e.g. mating logic, fertility window, degeneracy)
- Exposure to query-related problems (e.g. N+1) and optimization paths

### üìê Domain-Driven Design Concepts
- Rich domain model with **business rule enforcement**
- Custom exceptions like `MatingException` with cause codes
- Clear separation between **use case logic** and **infrastructure concerns**

### üõ†Ô∏è Developer Tooling & Diagnostics
- Detailed `logback-spring.xml` with `%M`, `%line`, `%highlight()` for rich logs
- Environment-specific Spring profiles (`dev`, `test`, `prod`)
- Didactic Javadoc to explain rationale and design choices

### üìö Educational Value
- Expand didactic Javadoc coverage
- Embed rationale directly in code and configuration
- Use as a live teaching tool for junior developers



## To come
### üß™ Test Improvements & Metrics
- Visual display of test execution flow and timing
- Runtime fixture reporting and diagnostics
- Smarter test assertions (snapshot diffs, field-aware comparison)
- Parallelized test execution

### üõ¢Ô∏è Deeper Hibernate Topics
- Detached entity handling and merge patterns
- Lazy loading traps and how to resolve them safely
- L2 caching and query cache experimentation

### üìú API Contracts & Versioning
- OpenAPI YAML generation & validation
- Backward-compatible API design
- Versioning of endpoints and data contracts

### ‚úÖ Validation & Error Reporting
- Full-fledged input validation (Hibernate Validator / Jakarta Bean Validation)
- User-friendly error messages and API responses
- Localization-ready error structures

### üïµÔ∏è Observability & Logging
- Structured logging of domain/business events
- Log filtering based on environment
- (Optional) Integration with monitoring tools (e.g. Prometheus/Grafana)

### Other
- Actuaor

# Excercises

## Exercise 01: Hibernate bi-directional relationship and cascade 

### Branches
- exercises/01_hibernate_owning_side_cascade/problem
- exercises/01_hibernate_owning_side_cascade/solution_1
- exercises/01_hibernate_owning_side_cascade/solution_2

### Objective

These are the bidirectional relationships that we have: <br />
  PetClinic <- OneToMany -> Owner <- oneToMany -> Pet
  
The objective of the exercise √Æs to fix the `ClinicService#createClinic` method so that a `PetClinic` with its `Owners` and their `Pets` is fully persisted.

### Instructions

- Fix missing relationships (`setClinic`, `setOwner`, etc.)
- Use appropriate `CascadeType`s on `@OneToMany`, or not.
- Make the test in `ClinicServiceTest` pass

### Run

```bash
mvn clean test
```
