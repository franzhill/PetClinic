# Spring Boot application configuration for the "test" profile
# Used during integration testing with @SpringBootTest or similar
# 
# This file is automatically picked up by Spring Boot when the 'test'
# profile is active — typically via:
# - @ActiveProfiles("test") on your test class
# - Or by passing -Dspring.profiles.active=test to the JVM
#
# If no active profile is specified, this file is NOT loaded.

      cache:
        # Why disable cache in integration tests:
        #  1. Tests should verify actual DB persistence and retrieval — not cache hits
        #  2. Caches can introduce state leakage between tests
        #  3. Rollbacks or mocks may not invalidate cache content
        #  4. Simpler and faster test startup
        #
        # When NOT to disable cache:
        # - When specifically testing cache behavior or performance
