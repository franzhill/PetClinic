**PetClinic** is my umbrella GitHub project in which I explore common and advanced use cases of Spring Boot/JRA/Hibernate technologies, discuss design choices, and host standalone tools like performance profilers, or **Moxter** - a standalone 'fixture' engine designed to help with Java API JUnit testing.
