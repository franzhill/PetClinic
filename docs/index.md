# WELCOME

**PetClinic** is my umbrella GitHub project in which I explore common and advanced use cases of Spring Boot/JPA/Hibernate technologies, discuss design choices, and host standalone tools like performance profilers, or **Moxter** - a framework designed to help with JUnit scenario testing of Java API projects.

**Moxter** (previously *FixtureEngine*) is a lightweight, standalone, configuration-oriented framework designed to help shape and organize API-level JUnit test scenarios, sitting in the sweet spot between pure isolated unit testing with tools like `Mockito`, and external API testing with tools like `Postman`.
